Knead the Dough","text":"<ol> <li>Knead by Hand: Once the dough has come together, knead it by hand. Push the dough away from you with the heel of your hand, then fold it back over itself, rotate, and repeat. Knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a small amount of flour. If it\u2019s too dry, add a tiny bit of water.</li> <li>Rest the Dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This relaxes the gluten and makes it easier to roll out.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"main-courses/pasta/#3-roll-the-dough","title":"3. Roll the Dough","text":"<ol> <li>Divide the Dough: Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Work with one piece at a time and keep the rest wrapped to prevent them from drying out.</li> <li>Flatten the Dough: Flatten the piece of dough into a rough rectangle with your hands or a rolling pin.</li> <li>Set Up the Pasta Machine: Set your pasta machine to the widest setting (usually setting 0 or 1).</li> <li>Roll the Dough: Feed the dough through the machine, turning the handle with one hand while guiding the dough with the other. Fold the dough into thirds and pass it through the machine again at the widest setting. Repeat this process 3-4 times to knead the dough further.</li> <li>Thin the Dough: Gradually reduce the setting on the pasta machine, passing the dough through each setting twice without folding, until you reach the desired thickness. Most pasta types are rolled to a thickness setting of 5 or 6 on a typical pasta machine.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"main-courses/pasta/#4-cut-and-shape-the-pasta","title":"4.
