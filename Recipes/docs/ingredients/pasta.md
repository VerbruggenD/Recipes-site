# Homemade Pasta Recipe

## Ingredients
- 400g '00' flour
- 2 large eggs
- A pinch of salt
- Extra flour for dusting

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Dough
1. **Make a Flour Well**: On a clean work surface, mound the flour and make a well in the center.
2. **Add Eggs**: Crack the eggs into the well and add a pinch of salt.
3. **Mix the Dough**: Use a fork to beat the eggs gently, then gradually incorporate the flour from the sides of the well into the eggs. Once the mixture becomes too stiff to mix with the fork, use your hands to continue combining the flour and eggs.

### 2. Knead the Dough
1. **Knead by Hand**: Once the dough has come together, knead it by hand. Push the dough away from you with the heel of your hand, then fold it back over itself, rotate, and repeat. Knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a small amount of flour. If itâ€™s too dry, add a tiny bit of water.
2. **Rest the Dough**: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This relaxes the gluten and makes it easier to roll out.

### 3. Roll the Dough
1. **Divide the Dough**: Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Work with one piece at a time and keep the rest wrapped to prevent them from drying out.
2. **Flatten the Dough**: Flatten the piece of dough into a rough rectangle with your hands or a rolling pin.
3. **Set Up the Pasta Machine**: Set your pasta machine to the widest setting (usually setting 0 or 1).
4. **Roll the Dough**: Feed the dough through the machine, turning the handle with one hand while guiding the dough with the other. Fold the dough into thirds and pass it through the machine again at the widest setting. Repeat this process 3-4 times to knead the dough further.
5. **Thin the Dough**: Gradually reduce the setting on the pasta machine, passing the dough through each setting twice without folding, until you reach the desired thickness. Most pasta types are rolled to a thickness setting of 5 or 6 on a typical pasta machine.

### 4. Cut and Shape the Pasta
1. **Cut the Dough**: Attach the desired cutting attachment to your pasta machine (e.g., fettuccine or spaghetti cutter). Feed the rolled dough through the cutter to form the pasta shapes.
2. **Dry the Pasta**: Lay the cut pasta on a floured surface or hang it on a pasta drying rack to prevent sticking.

### 5. Cook the Pasta
1. **Boil Water**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
2. **Cook the Pasta**: Add the fresh pasta and cook for 2-4 minutes, depending on the thickness. Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta.
3. **Drain and Serve**: Drain the pasta and serve with your favorite sauce.

## Tips
- **Flour Type**: Using '00' flour gives a smoother, more elastic dough, but all-purpose flour works well too.
- **Resting Time**: Allowing the dough to rest is crucial for achieving the right texture.
- **Storage**: Fresh pasta can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 weeks. To freeze, lay the pasta on a baking sheet and freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer bag.
