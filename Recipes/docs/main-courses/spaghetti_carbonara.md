# Spaghetti Carbonara

## Ingredients

- 500g (thicker) spaghetti preferably Barilla nÂ°5
- 200g pancetta/bacon/guanciale
- 4 large eggs
- 70g pecorino cheese
- 70g parmesan
- black pepper
- salt for boiling the pasta

## Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta:**
    - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
    - Cook the spaghetti a little shorter than specified time for a bit more bite.

2. **Prepare the saus:**
    - Grate the pecorino cheese and parmesan.
    - Beat the eggs in a medium bowl and add the cheese.

3. **Cook the bacon:**
    - Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
    - Add the pancetta/bacon/guanciale and cook until it becomes crispy. Make sure there is enough fat in the  skillet. The bacon fat brings the creamy taste to the saus.

!!! tip "Cooking tip"
    Reserve some pasta water before draining. You might need it to adjust the sauce's consistency.
    Make sure to remove the skillet from the heat before adding the egg mixture to avoid scrambling the eggs.

4. **Combine and serve:**
    - Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet with pancetta.
    - Remove from heat and quickly add the egg and cheese mixture, stirring constantly.
    - Adjust with reserved pasta water if needed.
    - Serve immediately, topped with extra cheese and black pepper.
