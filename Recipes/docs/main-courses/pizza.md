## Ingredients

### Dough
- 500g Italian "00" flour
- 325ml water (room temperature)
- 10g sea salt
- 1g fresh yeast or 0.5g dry yeast

### Topping
- 400g San Marzano tomatoes (canned, peeled, and crushed)
- 250g fresh mozzarella di bufala (drained and sliced)
- Fresh basil leaves
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Sea salt

## Instructions

### Dough Preparation
1. **Mixing the Dough:**
    - Dissolve the yeast in the water.
    - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
    - Gradually add the water and yeast mixture to the flour, mixing with your hands until a shaggy dough forms.
    - Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic.

2. **First Rise:**
    - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise at room temperature for 2 hours or until it doubles in size.

3. **Shaping and Second Rise:**
    - Divide the dough into 4 equal portions.
    - Shape each portion into a ball, place them on a floured surface, and cover with a damp cloth.
    - Let them rise for another 4-6 hours at room temperature.

### Pizza Assembly
1. **Preheat the Wood-Fired Oven:**
    - Start the fire in your wood-fired oven and heat it until the temperature reaches around 430°C (800°F). This usually takes 1-2 hours depending on your oven.
    - Once the oven is hot, push the coals to one side to create an even cooking surface.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**
    - Crush the San Marzano tomatoes by hand or use a blender for a smoother sauce.
    - Add a pinch of sea salt to taste.

3. **Shaping the Dough:**
    - On a lightly floured surface, take one dough ball and gently press it down with your fingers to form a disk.
    - Gradually stretch the dough using your hands to form a 30cm circle, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust.

4. **Topping:**
    - Spread a thin layer of the crushed tomatoes over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
    - Tear the mozzarella di bufala into pieces and distribute evenly over the sauce.
    - Add a few fresh basil leaves.
    - Drizzle a small amount of extra virgin olive oil on top.

### Baking
1. **Bake the Pizza:**
    - Using a pizza peel, transfer the pizza to the preheated wood-fired oven.
    - Bake for 90 seconds to 2 minutes, rotating the pizza occasionally to ensure even cooking.
    - The pizza is done when the crust is golden and slightly charred in spots, and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.

2. **Finish and Serve:**
    - Remove the pizza from the oven.
    - Add a few more fresh basil leaves and a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
    - Serve immediately.

Enjoy your traditional Napoletana pizza!
